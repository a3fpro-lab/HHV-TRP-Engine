7. What HHV–TRP does and does not do

7.1 Positive claims

This repository provides:
	1.	A fully explicit, test-covered Python implementation of a TRP-type
selection factor on top of Hartle–Hawking-style exit geometries.
	2.	A clear, documented mapping from CMB-like inputs ((A_s, r, N_e)) to a bound
on exit anisotropy (\epsilon_{\max}(N_e,H_I)).
	3.	A reusable interface for feeding in anisotropy predictions from more detailed
Hartle–Hawking/tunneling computations (e.g. numeric minisuperspace with
Bianchi IX, vector fields, etc.) and obtaining a TRP-based viability test.

7.2 Non-claims / limitations

This repository does not:
	•	Derive (\mu) or the quadratic complexity functional (C(\epsilon)) from a
microscopic theory of quantum gravity.
	•	Assert that the TRP bound supersedes or improves upon existing CMB constraints
on anisotropy or (r); it is an observer-centric selection layer, not a
replacement for standard likelihood analyses.
	•	Provide a complete measure on the space of all exit geometries; it is meant to
be a factor that can be multiplied into existing Hartle–Hawking or tunneling
measures.

The intent is to give a clean, reproducible bridge: for any early-universe
model that produces a well-defined exit anisotropy parameter, HHV–TRP provides
a simple and testable mapping from that prediction to an observer-based
viability bound
